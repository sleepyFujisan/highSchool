#### highSchool code

each assignment is sorted into the different textbooks/assignments that they came from

final projects are seperate, and go in this order of progression: 201 -> 202 -> IB

the comment header at the top of each program will tell you the date, course, and purpose

***most programs will be slightly modified for ease of reading, but mostly will be the same terrible code that high school me wrote***

*this is terrible code, if i havent stated that enough*

have a good day/night/whatever

sincerely,
