#### highSchool code

each assignment is sorted into the different textbooks/assignments that they came from

final projects are seperate, and go in this order of progression: 201 -> 202 -> IB

the comment header at the top of each program will tell you the date, course, and purpose

have a good day/night/whatever

sincerely,
